ask me personally in case you need the model state dicts(alwyndsouza21092@gmail.com)
create a templates folder and place the HTML file within that folder
create a folder named static, within it create three more folders
namely,
1.plots
2.results
3.uploads
and then youo are ready to go.....[model state dicts are necessary!]
